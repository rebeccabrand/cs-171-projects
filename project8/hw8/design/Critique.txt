Homework 8
October 28th, 2020

Having read the articles included for this homework assignment,
I do have some skepticism about the linear gradient legend. However,
because I used a linear scale between "white" and "DarkCyan", any sort
of quantile legend or segmented legend would not represent the full scope of
colors that might show up on my map or bar chart at any given time. Instead,
the gradient shows the full breadth of available colors, and the current scope allows
the viewer to associate "DarkCyan" with increasing values and "white" with decreasing values.

"Maps are not objective, but a version of reality." - Great quote from the article!
Given the author's argument, it is not as helpful to map absolute cases in the United States
because of the immense population differences across states. However, having lived through
this pandemic, we know how major American cities became hotspots with fewer resources, and it could be
helpful to know the absolute number of cases and deaths in the context of the overall impact
of COVID-19 on the United States.

A couple possible solutions include:
1. Using the smallest geographic unit possible, like counties;
2. Using a sequential color scheme
3. Keeping the absolute values for the bar and table, but removing from the map.
